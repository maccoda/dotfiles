# Dotfiles

Just some of my dot files...

**This is expected to be cloned into `~/.maccoda_dotfiles`**
Firstly you will want to clone this:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/maccoda/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Best way to get started is via `bootstrap.sh`

These are managed by [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

Usage:

```shell
> cd ~/.dotfiles
> ./install
```

down.

Font: FiraCode Nerd Font (add ligatures)
