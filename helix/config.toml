# TODO: Add some muscle memory bindings (G, whole line interactions like yy, D, dd, etc)
# TODO: Integrate the-way snippets in some way (the interactive serach has issues for reloading could look at how they do the file picker with lf for ideas)
# TODO: Working with hunks and operating on git hunks like resetting is something I miss

# TODO: Learn some interesting use cases where we pipe the output of shell commands to achieve useful flows (git browse and blame can essentially be achieved by this)

### Missing ###
# Git blame
# Git browse
# Leap for navigation

### Things I like ###
# Little configuration
# Makes me use other better stand alone tools
# Which key navigation pop ups are a great reminder of key bindings since all have the same few leading keys
# Treesitter navigation options built in is great
